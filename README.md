# The Pokéboard game

6th project OpenClassrooms training - turn-based board game

## Description

The Pokéboard game project is the 6th project in my training to become a frontend developer. It's a turn-based board game where two players compete against each other until one is K.O. Here, players each have a pokémon and can collect CT(technical capsules) to increase their damage. There are also obstacles that prevent them from passing.
